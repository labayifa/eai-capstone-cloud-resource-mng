Amazon Web Services S3 Storage pricing:


You pay for storing objects in your S3 buckets. The rate you’re charged depends on your objects' size, how long you stored the objects during the month, and the storage class—S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-Infrequent Access, S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access, S3 Express One Zone, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Formerly S3 Glacier), and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. You pay a monthly monitoring and automation charge per object stored in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class to monitor access patterns and move objects between access tiers. In S3 Intelligent-Tiering there are no retrieval charges, and no additional tiering charges apply when objects are moved between access tiers.

There are per-request ingest charges when using PUT, COPY, or lifecycle rules to move data into any S3 storage class. Consider the ingest or transition cost before moving objects into any storage class. Estimate your costs using the AWS Pricing Calculator.

* S3 Intelligent-Tiering can store objects smaller than 128 KB, but auto-tiering has a minimum eligible object size of 128 KB. These smaller objects will not be monitored and will always be charged at the Frequent Access tier rates, with no monitoring and automation charge. For each object archived to the Archive Access tier or Deep Archive Access tier in S3 Intelligent-Tiering, Amazon S3 uses 8 KB of storage for the name of the object and other metadata (billed at S3 Standard storage rates) and 32 KB of storage for index and related metadata (billed at S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage rates).
** S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA storage have a minimum billable object size of 128 KB. Smaller objects may be stored but will be charged for 128 KB of storage at the appropriate storage class rate. S3 Standard-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA storage are charged for a minimum storage duration of 30 days, and objects deleted before 30 days incur a pro-rated charge equal to the storage charge for the remaining days. Objects that are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a different storage class before 30 days will incur the normal storage usage charge plus a pro-rated charge for the remainder of the 30-day minimum. This includes objects that are deleted as a result of file operations performed by File Gateway. Objects stored for 30 days or longer will not incur a 30-day minimum charge. 

*** For each object that is stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes, AWS charges for 40 KB of additional metadata for each archived object, with 8 KB charged at S3 Standard rates and 32 KB charged at S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Deep Archive rates. This allows you to get a real-time list of all of your S3 objects using the S3 LIST API or the S3 Inventory report. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval has a minimum billable object size of 128 KB. Smaller objects may be stored but will be charged for 128 KB of storage at the appropriate storage class rate. Objects that are archived to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval and S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval are charged for a minimum storage duration of 90 days, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive has a minimum storage duration of 180 days. Objects deleted prior to the minimum storage duration incur a pro-rated charge equal to the storage charge for the remaining days. Objects that are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a different storage class before the minimum storage duration will incur the normal storage usage charge plus a pro-rated storage charge for the remainder of the minimum storage duration. Objects stored longer than the minimum storage duration will not incur a minimum storage charge. For customers using the S3 Glacier direct API, pricing for API can be found on the S3 Glacier API pricing page.

Reference the S3 developer guide for technical details on Data Retrievals.

S3 Lifecycle Transition request pricing below represents requests to that storage class. For example, transitioning data from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access will be charged $0.01 per 1,000 requests.

There are no retrieval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. If an object in the infrequent access tier is accessed later, it is automatically moved back to the frequent access tier. No additional tiering charges apply when objects are moved between access tiers within the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

S3 Lifecycle Transition request pricing above represents requests to that storage class.
